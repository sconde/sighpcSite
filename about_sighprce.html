            <!--<small> Subtext for header</small>-->
        </h1>
        <p>
        Computational research provides the most advanced computing technology to accelerate 
        discovery for national competitiveness, global security and economic success, as well as develop 
        a diverse and well-prepared 21st century work force. Computational science and engineering 
        provides the potential for addressing many problems facing countries on the African continent. 
        High Performance Computing (HPC) in Africa is in its embryonic stage, and growth requires 
        significant increased investment in infrastructure, accompanied by increased scope and 
        innovation in the basic STEM disciplines. The Special Interest Group on High Performance 
        Computing for Resource Constrained Environments (SIGHPC-RCE) provides a forum for 
        industry, academics, and government entities to build partnership, collaboration, and outreach 
        initiatives towards addressing these challenges. </p>

        <p>
        Scarce computational resources, in particular basic infrastructure for computational research and 

        core competencies, must be shared with well-defined mutually beneficial purposes, through 

        active outreach initiatives.</p>

        <p>
        We laid the foundations with a well-attended ad-hoc SC14 BoF session, titled: “Developing HPC 

        in Resource Constrained Environments”, identified the need for the formation of a formal 

        organization dedicated to addressing these challenges. The result is a new ACM Special Interest 

        Group on High Performance Computing chapter, named SIGHPC-RCE. </p>

        <p>Active participation in this initiative is welcomed from academia and research scientists from 

        the aforementioned environments, HPC vendors interested in providing product and service 

        solutions for the emerging market of HPC infrastructure in Africa, and anyone else interested in 

        the success of these efforts.<p>

        <p>We seek to develop pragmatic paradigms that will create synergistic collaboration among 

        members (academia, research scientist and HPC administrators) of the chapter, vendors and 

        leaders of HPC outreach initiatives in Africa like STEM-Trek and Center for High Performance 

        Computing South Africa (CHPC) to allow the cross-pollination of ideas and innovation from a 

        multinational community.</p>

        <p>
        SIGHPC-RCE will inspire and solicit 
        <ul class="mission">
            <li> Donations pipeline of up-cycled hardware and software from government-supported 

            cyber infrastructures, vendors and commercial data centers. </li>

            <li> Resource-sharing and the innovation of cloud-enabled, virtual environments that will 

            broaden engagement in the use and training in HPC. </li>

            <li> Partnerships, collaborations and outreach initiatives will be fostered to help influence 

            educators, legislators and industrial leaders about the importance of an S&T educational 

            and research investment in Africa. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>SIGHPC-RCE members will become HPC ambassadors who explain why STEM education is 

        important, that women must be provided equal access to opportunities and how HPC will 

        transform the African experience. </p>

         

        <p> Additionally, SIGHPC-RCE will inspire the development of tools that will help researchers from 

        under-served regions accelerate the process of scientific discovery. </p>

        <p>While the group’s roots are in Nigeria, SIGHPC-RCE intends to advocate on behalf of resource-

        constrained and underrepresented entities everywhere! </p>
